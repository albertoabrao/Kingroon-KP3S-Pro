This is a fork of Marlin bugfix-2.1.x, current as of September 1, 2023. 

Tested working on a Kingroon KP3S Pro with a 3D Touch plugged on the Z+ connector. Z- is empty.

I have returned the printer since, so use it at your own risk. The menus are messy, but there are some customized options that should assist with leveling.

I am publishing this because it worked well, and it may be useful to someone. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer if I can.
